        aboutDataOfDogs["Canine Distemper"] = "Canine distemper is a highly contagious, often fatal disease, caused by a virus that attacks the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and the nervous systems. Its epidemiology is complicated by the large number of species susceptible to infection."
        aboutDataOfDogs["Infectious Canine Hepatitis"] = "Infectious canine hepatitis has signs that range from a slight fever and congestion to severe depression, marked leukopenia, and coagulation disorders."
        aboutDataOfDogs["Canine Parvovirus"] = "Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) attacks the gastrointestinal tract of puppies and dogs. There are 3 variants of the virus, CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c, which evolved only a few years after the first antigenic variants were discovered."
        aboutDataOfDogs["Rabies"] = "Rabies is a fatal disease that attacks the nervous system. All warm-blooded animals, including humans, are vulnerable to infection with rabies virus. Most human exposures result from contact with domestic species, such as dogs, cats, horses, or cattle. Worldwide, more than 30,000 people die from rabies each year.29"
        aboutDataOfDogs["Bordetellosis"] = "Bordetella (also referred to as tracheobronchitis, canine cough) is a highly contagious respiratory disease in cats and dogs caused by the bacteria Bordetella bronchiseptica. It causes inflammation of the trachea and bronchi."
        aboutDataOfDogs["Canine Parainfluenza Virus"] = "Canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) is a highly contagious respiratory virus and is one of the most common pathogens of infectious tracheobronchitis, also known as canine cough"
        aboutDataOfDogs["Leptospirosis"] = "Leptospirosis is an infectious disease that causes serious illness in dogs, other animals, and people. The disease is caused by spiral-shaped bacteria called leptospires that live in water or warm, wet soil."
        aboutDataOfDogs["Borreliosis"] = "Borreliosis or Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by ticks to dogs, as well as to other animals and people."
        
        aboutDataOfCats["Feline Distemper"] = "Feline panleukopenia virus or Feline Distemper is a species of parvovirus that can infect all wild and domestic members of the felid family worldwide. It is a highly contagious, severe infection that causes gastrointestinal, immune system, and nervous system disease."
        aboutDataOfCats["Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis"] = "Rhinotracheitis is a respiratory disease caused by herpesvirus-1. “Rhinotracheitis” means inflammation of the nose and windpipe, or trachea. Herpesvirus-1 also affects the reproductive tract and can cause problems during pregnancy. Feline herpesvirus type 1 is responsible for 80% to 90% of infectious feline upper respiratory diseases."
        aboutDataOfCats["Feline calicivirus"] = "Calicivirus is a common virus in cats that causes upper respiratory infection. Feline calicivirus is resistant to many disinfectants and can survive outside a cat’s body for several days."
        aboutDataOfCats["Rabies"] = "Rabies is a fatal disease that attacks the nervous system. All warm-blooded animals, including humans, are vulnerable to infection with rabies virus. Most human exposures result from contact with domestic species, such as dogs, cats, horses, or cattle. Worldwide, more than 30,000 people die from rabies each year."
        aboutDataOfCats["Chlamydia"] = "This upper respiratory infection in cats typically causes symptoms such as sneezing, watery eyes and runny nose."
        aboutDataOfCats["Feline leukemia"] = "Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus that replicates within many tissues, including bone marrow, salivary glands, and respiratory epithelium"
        aboutDataOfCats["Bordetella"] = "Bordetella (also referred to as tracheobronchitis, or feline bordetellosis) is a highly contagious respiratory disease in cats and dogs caused by the bacteria Bordetella bronchiseptica. It causes inflammation of the trachea and bronchi."
