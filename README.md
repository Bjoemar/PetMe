# PetMe

This app is an iOS App still in development. This app is intended for pet owners to add and track important information about their pets, a few of them are vaccination dates and information, mood tracking and reminders. Users will be able to invite other users to their group(family members or roommates for example) and this way they will be able to see shared information about their own pets.
PetMe is still development so I will for sure update this readme with screenshots and more information about the app and it's technologies in the future.

Thank you,
